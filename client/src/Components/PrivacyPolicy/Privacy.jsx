              <strong>1.</strong> <strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?</strong>
            </h2>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites, mobile applications, and other online or offline offerings — basically anything we do. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, mobile applications, and other offerings are all collectively called the "<strong>Services.</strong>" Beyond this Privacy Policy, your use of the Services is subject to our <a href="/app/terms&condition">DEV Community Terms</a> and our Forem Terms.</p>

            <p>The Services include both our own community forum at <a href="/">DevBlobs.io</a> (the "<strong>DEV Community</strong>") and the open source tool we provide called "<strong>Forem</strong>," available at <a href="https://www.forem.com/">https://www.forem.com</a> which allows our customers to create and operate their own online forums.</p>

            <p>We collect personal information from two categories of people: (1) our customers, who use Forem and our hosting services to run and host their own forums (we'll call them "<strong>Forem Operators</strong>"), and (2) the people who interact with DEV-hosted forums, including forums provided by Forem Operators utilizing Forem and separately our own DEV Community (we'll call them "<strong>Users</strong>").</p>

            <p><strong><u>An Important Note for Users</u></strong> Since we provide hosting services for Forem Operators, technically we also process your information on their behalf. That processing is governed by the contracts that we have in place with each Forem Operator, not this Privacy Policy. In other words, when you share your data on a DEV-hosted forum operated by a Forem Operator, we at DEV are basically just the "pipes" — we process the data on behalf of the Forem Operator, but don't do anything with it ourselves beyond what we're required to do under our contract (and by law). So, if you post your information on a DEV-powered forum provided by a Forem Operator, that Forem Operator's privacy policy applies, and any questions or requests relating to your data on that service should be directed to that Forem Operator, not us. Likewise, if you use our mobile application, you may also interact with forums that use DEV's open-source tools but do all their hosting and data collection themselves. For those forums, we at DEV have no access to your data, so be sure to read the privacy policy of any third-party hosted forum before posting.</p>

              2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
            </h2>

            <p>The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you're a User or Forem Operator, how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law. Br /eaking it down, we collect three types of information: (1) information that you provide to us directly, (2) information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and (3) information we get about you from other sources (such as third-party services and organizations). More details are below.</p>

            <h3>
              <a name="a-information-you-provide-to-us-directly" href="#a-information-you-provide-to-us-directly">
              </a>
              <strong>A.</strong> <strong>Information You Provide to Us Directly</strong>
            </h3>

            <p>We may collect the following personal information that you provide to us.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Account Creation (for Forem Operators):</strong> We'll require your name and email address to get started, as well as some details about the Forem you want to run, such as: whether you're running the Forem on your own behalf or as part of an organization, and details about the community you want to support (how big is it, what topics does it cover, where do members currently communicate, how/if the community earns money, whether the community is open, invite-only or paid, any  existing social media accounts, etc.) You'll need to tell us a bit  about your personal coding  background, and you'll have the option to  provide your DEV username as well, if you are a member of the DEV.to community.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Account Creation (for Users)</strong>: We collect name and email address from users that create an account on DEV Community. For other forums created by Forem Operators using Forem, the Forem Operator determines what information is required for User account creation for their respective forums.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Interactive Features (for Users)</strong>. Like any other social network, both we and other Users of our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., messaging and chat features, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, posts, and other social media pages). While we do have private messages that are only between you and the person you're messaging (as well as us and the Forem Operator, as applicable), any information you provide using the <u>public</u> sharing features of the Services, such as the information you post to your public profile or the topics you follow is public, including to recruiters and prospective employers, and is not subject to any of the privacy protections we mention in this Privacy Policy except where legally required. <strong>Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to others.</strong></p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Your Communications with Us (Users and Forem Operators)</strong>. We may collect personal  information, such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter or loyalty program, request customer or technical support, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Surveys</strong>. We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include personal information (for example, your home address).</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Sweepstakes or Contests</strong>. We may collect personal information you provide for any sweepstakes or contests that we offer. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information of sweepstakes and contest winners.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events</strong>. We may collect personal information from individuals when we attend conferences, trade shows, and other events.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Business Development and Strategic Partnerships</strong>. We may collect personal information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Job Applications</strong>. We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.</p></li>
            </ul>

In addition, we may collect information that other people provide about you when they use our Services, including information about you when they  tag you in their posts.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies</strong>. We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local  storage, and other technologies ("<strong>Technologies</strong>") to automatically collect information through your  use of our Services.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Cookies</strong>. Cookies are small text files placed in device br /owsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</strong>. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether  messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Operationally Necessary</strong>. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent<br />
            activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Performance-Related</strong>. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (<em>see Analytics below</em>).</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Functionality-Related</strong>. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Analytics</strong>. We may use Technologies and other third-party tools to process analytics information on our Services. Some of our analytics partners include Google Analytics. For more information,please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google Analytics' Privacy Policy</a>.

            <li><p><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong>. Our Services may contain social media buttons such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Instagram, and Twitch (that might include widgets such as the "share this" button or other interactive mini programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these platforms are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p></li>

            <p><strong>Refer-a-Friend and Similar Incentive Programs</strong>. As described above in the How We Use Your Personal Information section ("Share Content with Friends or Colleagues" subsection), we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For example, we may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide your personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party's data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a User or Forem Operator and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.</p>
